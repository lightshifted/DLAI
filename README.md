# DL.AI Captston Project: A Weekly Guide
This documentation outlines suggested courses of action taken each week. It's main purpose is to ensure our team stays on track 
and work is completed in a timely fasion.

## Week 8: Project proposal ##
#### The deliverables for this week are as follows: ####
1. Student Project Template
2. System Design and Ethics considerations
3. Project Proposal slides

## Week 9: Project Baselining and Code ##
#### The deliverables for this week are as follows: #### 
1. Find a base paper and code and start getting it to run for your local data set. In terms of product rollout timplan, the baseline work represents 
the version that is most adaptable, can be prepared with minimal time commitment and that requires minimal resources (bandwidth, fast turnaround, minimal GPU support etc.)
2. Complete data preprocessing steps for training of baseline classification model. 

#### Base papers: #### 
1. [Su. Q, Chen L. *A method for discovering clusters of e-commerce interest patterns using click-stream data.*(2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567422314000726?via%3Dihub)
2. [Roychowdhury S., et. al.*Categorizing Online Shopping Behaviour from Cosmetics to Electronics: An Analytical Framework.*(2020)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02503]

#### Week 9 Tasks: ####
* [data collection] Identify 1 public data set to benchmark on
* [data preprocessing] Extract *click-stream* data from data set, where *click-stream* data refers to the sequence of pages visited and the number of times these pages were viewed.
* [data preprocessing] Structure website categories using parsed URL information from `email_field_hist.csv`.
* [data preprocessing] Establish definition of user's interest using website categories that the user has visited (ascertained from tree topology) 
* [documentation] Complete definition of terms document for paper 1.
* [documentation] Create slide deck outlining goals and completed tasks for week 9
* [documentation] Create GitHub repository for project 
* [data preprocessing] Feature selection on `hubspot_export.csv' for 2 pre-selected targets
