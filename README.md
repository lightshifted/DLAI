# Deeplearning.ai Capstone Project Repository: Unveiling Customer Journeys and Market Segments

Welcome to the central hub for our capstone project in collaboration with Deeplearnng.ai. This repository serves as a comprehensive archive housing our project codebase, in-depth technical reports, and an assortment of other materials indispensable to our research endeavors.

## Overview of Our Research Approach
Our project is divided into two primary objectives:

1. **Analysis of User Customer Journeys:** Mapping and understanding the navigational behavior of users on Deeplearning.ai platform.
2. **Market Segmentation:** Identifying distinct market segments to enable targeted marketing and product positioning.

## Data Characteristics
The dataset provided to us by Deeplearnng.ai is devoid of any ground-truth labels, necessitating the use of unsupervised learning techniques to meet our research goals.

## Foundational Literature and Theoretical Frameworks
Our project is grounded in the contributions of several foundational papers that have previously explored similar problem spaces. Below is a list of key papers that have informed our methodology:
