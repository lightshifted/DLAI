# Welcome to our Deeplearnng.ai capstone project repository!
Here you will find our project codebase, technical reports detailing our work and findings, and other relevant project materials.

### Project approach: 
The project was divided into two tasks: 
1. Analysis of users' customer journey
2. Market segmentation

The intial dataset provided to us by DeepLearning.ai contained no ground truth labels. Therefore, we relied upon unsupervised learning methods to accomplish our tasks.
